## HTTP vs HTTPS
when the communication happen between server and client:
- in http (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) data is unencrypted 
- in https: data is encrypted which means more Security

## What are TLS/SSL certificates
- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL): security technology for establishing an encrypted link between a server and a client,
ssl have two keys for encrypting: 

1.public key: 
Public key to encrypt data, browser can have it when entering any website
2. private key: found only in the server side and it's used to decrypt data encrypted to you  

- Transport Layer Security (TLS): it's an improved version of SSL
